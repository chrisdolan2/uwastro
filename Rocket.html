    Help for Rocket/Asteroid Applet -- Chris Dolan, UWisc Astronomy, 1998<br />
    <br />
    You can use this program to watch a realistic animation of our solar system.<br />
    Click the "Run" button to start or stop the simulation<br />
    Click the "Restart" button put the planets back where they started.<br />
    Click the "Options" button to change the orbit of the Rocket or Asteroid.<br />
    You can increase or decrease the speed of the animation by changing the time step.<br />
    You can zoom in or zoom out to see different views of the solar system.<br />
    By default, you are looking down at the solar system centered on the Sun, but
        you can change which body to center on with the pull-down menu.<br />
    If you click "Draw Trails" the planets will leave dots along their paths so
        you can trace the orbits.<br />
    <br />
    --- Options Page ---<br />
    <br />
    <div class="rocketmode">
      Rocket Mode:<br />
      On the Options screen, you can adjust when the Rocket blasts off from the Earth
          as well as how fast and in which direction it goes.  For the sake of
          simplicity, the launch velocity is a simple speed relative to the Earth,
          ignoring the complication of the Earth's gravity.<br />
      If you turn on "Capture Physics" at the bottom of the page, then if the Rocket
          gets within 3 million km of a planet, it will land.<br />
      If the Rocket successfully lands on another planet, it will wait a certain amount
          of time (specified on the Options screen) and then take off again to try to
          get back to Earth, based on the direction and velocity you enter.<br />
      The "Destination" is used to tell the program where you are trying to send the
          Rocket.  You can actually land on any planet even if it is not your stated
          destination, but the program will only report by how much you missed a planet
          if it is your destination.<br />
      The default scenario is that the Rocket and the planets all move in a
          two-dimensional plane (ignoring distance in and out of the screen) for
          simplicity.  If you turn off "Use 2D physics" then the full-blown 3D
          motions of the planets will be used.  In this case, the screen is in the
          plane of the Earth's orbit.  In 3D physics it is nearly impossible to
          simulate a gravity assist off another planet, since there is no way to
          specify the Rocket's inclination from the Ecliptic plane.<br />
    </div>
    <div class="asteroidmode">
      Asteroid Mode:<br />
      On the Options screen, you can enter parameters to specify where the asteroid is
          when you first look at it.  You specify<br />
          (1) how far it is from the Earth, which you can deduce via parallax measurements;<br />
          (2) what's the angle from the Sun, which you can deduce from the coordinates of
              the asteroid and the time of the observations;<br />
          (3) the tangential velocity of the asteroid, which you can deduce from the proper
              motion of the asteroid, along with its distance from the Earth;<br />
          (4) the radial velocity of the asteroid, which you can measure by observing a
              spectrum of the asteroid.<br />
      If you turn on "Capture Physics" at the bottom of the page, then if the Asteroid
          gets within 400,000 km of a planet, it will collide.  Of course, in reality it
          has to get much closer than this, but we thought we'd make this a little more
          interesting.<br />
      The default scenario is that the Asteroid and the planets all move in 3D space.  If
          you turn on "2D physics" then the program ignores the motions and distance in
          and out of the screen.  This makes it much more likely that you will see collisions
          or gravity slingshots in the motion of the asteroid.  In 3D space, these encounters
          are extremely rare, since the orbital plane of the Asteroid is inclined to the
          orbits of all the planets except the Earth.<br />

    --- About this program ---<br />
    This program is a realistic simulation of the major bodies in our solar system.<br />
    It uses only Newton's Law of gravity (F=GMm/r^2) to simulate the motions of the
        planets.<br />
    The technique to translate forces into an animation is called an "N Body Algorithm"
        where in this case, N=11 (the Sun, nine planets and a Rocket or Asteroid).<br />
    Specifically, it is an adaptive step-size, Runga-Kutta integrator algorithm<br />
    Even the Sun moves due to the tug of the planets, but its motion is very small
        since its mass is so large.<br />
    
    As implied above, this program is multi-purpose.  Depending on the initial
        parameters, this acts as either a Rocket simulator for the Astro 114 Astronautics
        lab or as an Asteroid simulator for the Astro 114 Doomsday Asteroid lab.  The key
        difference is the way the Options page behaves.<br />
