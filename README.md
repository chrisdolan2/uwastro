# Overview

This is a recreation of a Java applet created by me (Chris Dolan) in
the 1990s for a University of Wisconsin Astronomy lab course.

The original source code was
http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/java/nbody/Rocket.java but I was
unable to run it, so this recreation comes from that source code plus
a few screenshots.

# Setup, compilation

Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download

Update to the newest npm: `sudo npm install -g npm`

`npm install typescript`
